# Rebuild Repository Created

A new clean-slate repository was created at:

- `/workspace/Polytope-Executive-Agent-Rebuild`

## What was initialized
- New Git repository (`main` branch)
- Scaffold directories: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`, `infra/`, `scripts/`
- Seed files:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `.gitignore`
  - `scripts/bootstrap.sh`

## Initial commit in new repository

```bash
bash -lc 'NEW_REPO=/workspace/Polytope-Executive-Agent-Rebuild; mkdir -p "$NEW_REPO"/{backend,frontend,docs,infra,scripts}'
```
